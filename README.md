# Final-Year-Project-Crowd-Facial-Emotions-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
This repository contains the source code and resources for a crowd facial emotions detection project leveraging Deep Learning techniques. The project aims to develop an efficient and accurate system capable of detecting and analyzing emotions from crowds in images. The system is designed to handle various scenarios,including crowded events, public spaces, and surveillance applications. The project focuses on recognizing emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutrality from facial expressions in images.

# Key Features:
Utilizes the FER2013 dataset for training and testing the CNN model.
Implements a CNN architecture for feature extraction and emotion classification.
Preprocesses images by resizing them to 48x48 pixels, converting to grayscale, and normalizing pixel values.
Includes code for model training, evaluation, and inference using TensorFlow and Keras.

# Requirements:
Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
Keras
OpenCV
MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks)

# Usage:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the provided Jupyter notebook or Python script for training, testing, and inference.

# Note:
This project is part of a larger effort to develop a real-time facial emotion detection system for various applications, including human-computer interaction and emotional analysis.
